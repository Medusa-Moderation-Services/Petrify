# Petrify
The public version of the Moderation Infractions Database maintained by the **Basilica Corporation**, known to the community as **Petrify**.

## Purpose
Acting as ***Basilica Corporation***'s © Moderation Service, this project allows for all moderation data for repeat and more serious infractions to be stored in one place in which all ***Basilica Corporation*** © games can access.

The purpose of the public version of Petrify is to allow our community to access a slightly outdated version of our infractions database to secure their own games.
